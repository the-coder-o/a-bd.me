In May 2021, I joined the application development team at Hines â€”one of the largest privately held real estate investors and managers in the world. Our team is responsible for building a suite of applications that help Hines manage its $81.7B Portfolio of Assets Under Management, serving 27 countries worldwide, and doing so successfully for over 64 years.

## Transforming the industry

At Hines, we believe strongly in pushing the boundaries to shape the future and build a better world by getting into a state of mind of innovation. It is a goal to transform the real estate industry by placing innovation at the very core of the company.

What differentiates Hines is a tailored approach to global real estate investing. We continue to evaluate and incorporate new technologies, as opposed to only using cookie-cutter solutions. Best said by the companyâ€™s founder:

> I believe we can always improve, either by rethinking existing ways of doing things, or by thinking outside the box. This is innovation. â€“Gerald D. Hines

By going the Django way we can use a classical MVT (Model View Template) approach to build our applications, and create robust and scalable applications that are easy to maintain and extend.
