### About the Project

This project was created to provide a comprehensive and interactive overview of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dashboard was built using Django and Plotly.js, and featured a fully interactive map made using Mapbox. The project was open source and received over 200k visitors, but the most rewarding part was the collaboration with contributors across the world.

### Mobile first design

I designed the dashboard with a mobile-first approach, ensuring that the application was responsive to all platforms and viewports. Thankfully plotly and Mapbox are already mobile responsive to multi touch interactions so it was just a matter of ensuring the overall layout was adaptable.
