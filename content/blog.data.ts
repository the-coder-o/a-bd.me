          "While there are many UI libraries available, from my experience, I always found myself overriding the default styles of the library to match my project's design language. UI libraries can be a great choice for small projects where you want to quickly create a functional and visually appealing user interface.\n" +

          'However, at scale, you typically have branding and a company design language that you want to follow or set forth. In these cases, using a UI library may not be the best approach as it can be challenging to customize the styles to fit your branding and design requirements.\n' +
          '\n' +
          "Instead, creating custom components using a utility-first CSS framework like Tailwind can be a better option, as it allows for more flexibility and control over the styling of the components. Overall, while UI libraries can be useful for smaller projects, it's important to consider the specific requirements and constraints of each project before making a decision on which approach to take.",
